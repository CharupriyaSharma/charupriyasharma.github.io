I am a PhD student in the David Cheriton School of Computer Science at University of Waterloo, under the supervision of [Dr. Peter van Beek](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~vanbeek/) in the Artificial Intelligence lab. My research interests are in optimization problems in unsupervised learning, with a focus on probabilistic graphical models.
Previously, I finished my Masters in Combinatorics andOptimization in 2017 under the supervision of [Dr. Laura Sanita](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~lsanita/), also at the University of Waterloo. Before that, I completed a Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering at IIIT-Delhi in 2015.
