title: [A Score-and-Search Approach to Learning Bayesian Networks with Noisy-OR](http://academicpages.github.io/files/paper1.pdf)

excerpt: 'In this paper, we show how to extend the score-and-search approach to the important and widely useful case of noisy-OR relations. We provide an effective gradient descent algorithm to score a candidate noisy-OR using the widely used BIC score and we provide pruning rules that allow the search to successfully scale to medium sized networks. Our empirical results provide evidence for the success of our approach to learning Bayesian networks that incorporate noisy-OR relations.'
